							<h2>UPDATE</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Our virtual race is taking place on Saturday 2 May which is rapidly approaching. Thanks to everybody who has been in touch already, there’s still time to sign up if you haven’t already. This could even be a good occasion for you to see how you do at trying to run any of the distance if you haven’t tried them before. It doesn’t matter what time you’re going to do (there are no prizes) what’s important is taking part.</p>
							<p>The start time for the race is between 10 and 11am (although we will probably be flexible if you are a little late!), but ideally if you can start as close to 10 as possible so results start coming in around the same time.</p>
							<p>To take part all you need to join the Louise Michel Sports Club public events group on Strava - <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/LMSC-virtual" target="_blank">https://www.strava.com/clubs/LMSC-virtual</a> and record your run on Strava. Rename it to something obvious like "Louise Michel Sports Club Virtual Race - (your distance)" and set the run as "Public" (it can't be followers only, it must be public). We'll then log it as an entry. If you're not on Strava and are unable to sign up (or for whatever reason are unwilling to set the run to public) , then we'll accept a link sent to us recorded on any of the major running apps, but Strava is the preferred option! The email address to send your run to is <a href="mailto:info@louisemichel.club">info@louisemichel.club</a>. If you want, send us a selfie of yourself before, during or after your run which we will use when advertising your time (faces can be hidden if requested).</p>
							<p>Please be mindful of social distancing when picking a route, if you’re planning on doing a half marathon it might not be a great idea to do dozens of laps of a small park which is being used by others. If you’re going for a PB it’d be worth finding a route which doesn’t cross lots of roads because stopping and starting at traffic lights can slow you down.</p>
							<p>It can also be worth trying to find a relatively flat route, somewhere close to rivers and seafronts can work well. If you’re doing a distance greater than 10k, it’s worth taking water and food with you for the run. If you can’t carry water or food easily, why not pick a route which loops past your front door where you could stop to drink and eat? From the long distance forecast, it's looking like it'll be perfect running weather across the south of England!</p>
							<p>Finally, after the run please <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/242939710094790/" target="_blank">join us at 7pm for a livestream of our launch event</a>, where we’ll announce all the winners of the various distances and we’ll listen to talks about socialist sports clubs and Louise Michel who we have named our club after, from writer Gabriel Kuhn, lecturer Dr Constance Bantman and local historian Neil Gordon-Orr.</p>

							<h2>DETAILS</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Many of us who have come together to form our club planned to take part in marathons and half marathons this year - for most of us our first. However, understandably every event we had runners training for has been - or imminently will be - postponed or cancelled. We’ve also not held any face to face events since the WHO declared a global pandemic and we strongly support a strategy of social distancing. But we also don't want to stop training - running is great for boosting our immune systems and for many of us running is a vital part of our mental health. With this in mind, we’re organising a “virtual race”. Obviously, keeping everyone safe is our top priority, and so we are asking everyone to make sure they do their run alone - the last thing we want is for anyone to break social distancing!</p>
							<p>The idea is that on Saturday 2nd May, we all run the distance we’ve been training for over the past few months - by ourselves - whether it’s a marathon, half-marathon, 10k or even 5k. By doing this we’ll be able to keep ourselves fit, healthy and mentally well, while helping to limit the spread of the coronavirus - a combination of social distancing with collective activity. In the coming weeks we’ll post up some ideas for plotting a safe route.</p>
							<p>Even if you havent been training and are just bored in lockdown, why not do a <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/couch-to-5k-week-by-week/" target="_blank">couch to 5K?</a></p>
							<p>We’re suggesting everybody starts running between 10:00AM and 11:00AM but we can be a little bit flexible. Log the activity on <a href="https://www.strava.com" target="_blank">Strava</a> and ideally when finished send us a selfie. We'll make a group on Strava in advance of the event that everyone can join and will use to compile everyone's results. We’re going to be holding a livestream of our club's launch event in the early evening with a selection of interesting speakers, which we hope everybody taking part will be able to attend, where we will announce the overall rankings.</p><p>We’d love to have as many as you as possible with us (in a non-physical sense!), so if you’re interested, please get in touch - we aren’t able to offer any fancy formal registration, so just email and expression of interest and the distance you plan to do to: <a href="mailto:info@louisemichel.club">info@louisemichel.club</a></p>
							<p>Good luck and stay safe!</p>
