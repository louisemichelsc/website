							<h2>DETAILS</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Many of us who have come together to form our club had planned to take part in marathons and half marathons over this spring/summer, for most of us our first. However, understandably every marathon or half-marathon we had runners training for this spring has been - or imminently will be - postponed or cancelled. We’ve also not held any face to face events since the WHO declared a ‘global pandemic’, and we strongly support a strategy of social distancing. But we need to keep training - running is great for boosting our immune systems and for many of us running is a vital part of our mental health. With this in mind, we’re organising a “virtual race”. Obviously, keeping everyone safe is our top priority, and so we are asking everyone to make sure they do their run alone - the last thing we want is for anyone to break social distancing!</p>
							<p>The idea is that on Saturday 2nd May, we all run the distance we’ve been training for over the past few months - by ourselves - whether it’s a marathon, half-marathon, 10k or even 5k. Then when you’ve finished your run send us a selfie and a link to the activity on Strava and we’ll log your position on the overall rankings - we won’t be able to do this with the full accuracy of an official race, but we can get something to the nearest minute. Hopefully by doing this we’ll be able to keep ourselves fit, healthy and mentally well, while helping to limit the spread of the coronavirus - a combination of social distancing with collective activity. In the coming weeks we’ll post up some ideas for plotting a safe route.</p>
							<p>We’re suggesting everybody starts running between 10:00AM and 11:00AM but we can be a little bit flexible. We’re going to be holding a livestream of our club's launch event in the early evening with a selection of interesting speakers, which we hope everybody taking part will be able to attend, where we will announce the “winners”.</p>
							<p>We’d love to have as many as you as possible with us (in a non-physical sense!), so if you’re interested, please get in touch - we aren’t able to offer any fancy formal registration, so just email and expression of interest and the distance you plan to do to: <a href="mailto:info@louisemichel.club">info@louisemichel.club</a></p>
							<p>Good luck and stay safe!</p>
